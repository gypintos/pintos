			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

* timer.c, added:
	static struct list sleeping_list;
a list of sleeping thread

* thread.h added a member to thread struct:
	int64_t wake_ticks
For a thread that is sleeping, this variable indicates that when WAKE_TICKS
is less than global ticks, the thread is done sleeping


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

For time_sleep:
1) Check if ticks is valid(ticks > 0)
2) Calculate wake_ticks for the thread. This is done by adding the ticks to 
global ticks
3) Add current thread to sleeping list, which is a sorted list
4) Call thread_block()

For timer_interrupt:
1) Fetch the first thread in sleeping list
2) If the thread's wake_ticks <= global ticks, then remove it from
sleeping list, unblock this thread
3) repeat 1-2 until the thread's wake_ticks > global ticks or sleeping list 
is empty

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

Use sorted list to contain all the sleeping thread, so that the comparing
time for each interrupt is minimized.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

timer_sleep disable interrupt once it enters the critical section

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

timer_sleep disable interrupt once it enter the critical section, so 
timer interrupt would not happend during timer_sleep

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

This design use a sorted sleeping list, which is more efficient than 
the solution that go through each thread to check its wake up time.
Also the wake up only hanppens when timer interrupt occurs.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

thread.h
	/* The required lock which is hold by other thread */
*   struct lock *lock_required;   	
	/* A list of other threads which donate their priority to this thread,
	   since this thread hold the locks other threads need */
*   struct list dona_list;     
	/* List element for dona_list */     
*   struct list_elem dona_elem;    
 	/* The original priority when created or set by thread_set_priority*/ 
*   int orig_priority;             

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

The thread uses dona_list to track priority donation.

H,M,L are three threads whcih priority(H)>priority(M)>priority(L)

H -> M [Lock B] -> L[lock A]

Now, L is holding lock A before M is created, M is holding lock B
before H is created. M waits for lock A to preceed and H waits for
lock B to proceed.

Suppose at some time, H controls the cpu since H has the highest
priority. Priority donation happens at this situation:

H.dona_list: null
H.lock_required = lock B


H will donate its priority to M since M has lock B H needs.(H can find
M by check lock_B.holder). Since M waits for another lock -- lock A,
the donation will continure until it reach a thread waits no lock.
In this case, L will get the priority to resume from donation-chain
begin from H. 

M.dona_list: [H]
M.lock_required = lock A

L.dona_list: [M]
L.lock_required = null

L resumes. After L finished, L releases lock A and uses dona_list 
to return priority to M, M resume to preceed then after it finishes, 
M releases lock B and uses dona_list to return priority to H and so on

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

Semaphoer.waiters is a sorted list, which means each waiter is inserted
to the waiters list according to its priority. The highest priority thread
will come at first of the list. Also, whenever there is priority change 
among the waiters, it will be sorted again to get updated.

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

The sequence of events are as follow:
	1 This thread.lock_required will be updated to the lock it requires
	2 This thread will find the thread that holds the lock, and add
	  itself to holder thread's dona_list
	3 If holder thread's priority is higher than this thread, return
	4 Set holder thread's priority to this thread's priority
	5 If holder thread's is waiting no lock, return
	6 Set this thread to be holder thread, holder thread to be 
	  holder thread's lock holder, go back to 1

	The depth of the looper is limited by 8 in order to prevent
	infinite loops.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

The sequence of events are as follow:
	1 This thread's lock_required field will be set to null
	2 Threads that waitting for this lock in this thread's dona_list
	  will be removed.
	3 This thread's priority will be updated according to its dona_list
	3 THe highest priority thread that wait for this lock will be read 
	  status and inserted to thread readly list
	4 The highest priority thread in the ready list will get executed


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

While thread's priority is being updated, thread_set_priority is called,
will cause a race condition. Interrupt has to be disabled when prioriy 
thread_set_priority is called. As Interrup handler cannot acquire lock,
we cannot use lock to avoid this race. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

The reason I choose this design is that memory limitation requires using
variables as fewer as possilbe. Also by using a sorted linked list,
the priority problem becomes easier to handle.
